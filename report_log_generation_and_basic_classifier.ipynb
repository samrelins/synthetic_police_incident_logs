        "# Generating Synthetic Incident Logs\n",
        "\n",
        "The following is a short report of the pre-project experiments I ran, generating synthetic police incident reports. I've developed a proof-of-concept method that generates synthetic logs from the examples in Anthony Dixon's thesis, with a label for type of incident (e.g. \"burglary\" / \"domestic disturbance\") and a flag that indicates weather or not the example contains details of a mental health issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "The report is structured as follows: We begin by exploring the method for creating the synthetic logs - generating prompt-based instructions that ask for an example log based on a given scenario and the presence/absence of persons with a mental health difficulty. We'll then test two different instruction tuned LLMs, a smaller open source model running in the local environment, and then GPT3.5Turbo via the OpenAI API. Finally, we'll train a basic LLM classifier to identify logs that mention mental health issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you may have already noted, I've produced this report in a free Google Colab workspace, so you can run all the code yourself should you wish."

        "The results look somewhat promising. The generated examples often describe the scenarios requested and mention instances of mental health issues when they are supposed to. However there are also several issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the style of the prose isn't always the coarse note-taking form in the examples e.g. as correspondence  e.g. \"I am writing to inform you of an incident....\"\n",

        "* some example doesn't produce the desired output at all. Usually these errors seem to be generating another set of instructions in the style of the prompt (\"You were assigned the task of analyzing a series of...\")\n",
        "\n",
        "The latter two issues are often seen in the outputs from LLMs that have not been instruction-tuned - output from these models are generated according to the most likely continuation of the input text, and so will often simply generate more text in the style of the question or request, rather than answering the question or following the instructions in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's likely that any dataset generated by this model would require significant post-processing to clean the examples and remove any errors. Also, more significantly, the above responses takes around 3-4 minutes to run. Though this can certainly be made more efficient, it will still take many hours to generate 100s or 1000s of examples required to train a classification model in this sort of an environment. We could use more compute resources, though that would incur a cost, and probably wouldn't be good value based on the quality of the results generated.\n",

This approach offers some key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Improved Output Quality and Coherence**: The GPT3.5Turbo model is significantly larger and more advanced compared to Falcon 7B, so we can expect more accurate, coherent, and higher-quality outputs compared to the smaller model.\n",

        "The performance statistics indicate that the fine-tuned model achieves over 99% accuracy the validation dataset - this is data the model hasn't \"seen\" during training. However, it is worth noting that the high accuracy of the classifier could be explained by a general homogeneity of the synthetic logs within each class (MH and non-MH). For example, the LLM generating the synthetic examples may have over-used certain keywords or phrases when describing incidents involving mental health, such as \"disorder\", \"anxiety\", or even just the phrase \"mental health\" itself. Consequently, the classifier might rely heavily on these keywords to classify examples as mental health-related, and may not perform well in cases where these terms are not mentioned explicitly.\n",

        "To gain further insights and investigate the model's performance, we can examine examples from the validation set that have a high \"loss\" figure. The loss represents the discrepancy between the predicted likelihood (ranging from 0 to 1) that an example is mental health-related and the actual label. By analyzing examples with high loss values, we can identify instances where the model struggles to make accurate predictions.\n",
